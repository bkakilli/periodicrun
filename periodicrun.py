Library name: periodicrun
Description:
Python library for running a loop periodically with ~100 microseconds accuracy.
This library provides functionality for periodic execution of a method with accurate timing.
It is meant by accurate timing that periodicrun guaranties that the loop will run every x seconds with 100 microsends (default) accuracy.
periodicrun uses Python's built-in sched library to schedule the execution of the given method periodically.
